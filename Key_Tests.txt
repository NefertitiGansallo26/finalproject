Key tests for the code to pass:

1.Test: loading the dataset properly 
File: Tests/test_barplot.py 
Description:checks if the dataset has been loaded properly
Expected outcome:dataset loads sucessfully with no missing data

2.Test: column renaming
File: Tests/test_barplot.py 
Description:checks that the columns have been renamed correctly to shorter names
Expected outcome: column names updated with new names 

3.Test: country to continent mapping 
File: Tests/test_scatterplot.py 
Description: checks that countries in the dataset have been correctly mapped to their continent
Expected outcome:all countries in dataset are mapped to their correct continents 

4.Test: data filtering
File: Tests/test_scatterplot.py 
Description:checks if any originally missing data in dataset columns has been removed 
Expected outcome: any missing data in columns are removed from dataset

5.Test: colour matching to continents
File: Tests/test_scatterplot.py 
Description:checks that each continent has been assigned to a colour 
Expected outcome:each continent has a representative colour in the scatter plot and legend

6.Test: calculating averages
File: Tests/test_barplot.py 
Description:checks if average gdp per capita and average literacy rate has been calculated for each continent 
Expected outcome:average gdp per capita and average literacy rate calculated and displayed for each continent
