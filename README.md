## Data sources:
Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/literacy-rate-vs-gdp-per-capita

#### Hypothesis: Countries with higher literacy rates have a higher GDP per capita.

This project investigates the relationship between literacy rates and GDP per capita across different continents, using a dataset that contains global literacy rates and GDP per capita statistics. The project was developed using Python and its respective data science libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib. Unit tests were created using unittest and are verified through a CircleCI continous integration pipeline.
